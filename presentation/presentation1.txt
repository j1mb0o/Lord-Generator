Farewell, fair lips that whispered low
Of secrets kept and passions' glow;
In twilight's hush where shadows play
We danced beneath the moon's pale ray.

Thy eyes, like stars, shone bright and blue
As I, a wanderer, anew
Pledged fealty to love's sweet fire
And vowed to cherish thee, my heart's desire.

But now, alas! thy hand I hold
No longer warm with love's sweet gold;
The breeze that whispers secrets cold
Has blown away the moments of old.

Yet still I'll cherish every sigh
That thou didst breathe against mine eye;
And in my dreams, thy form shall be
A fleeting glimpse of ecstasy.
