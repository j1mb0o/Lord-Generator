As sunset's fiery edge doth fade,
And night's dark veil doth o'er the world be spread,
The stars above, like diamonds played,
Reflected on the lake's dark head.
A midnight breeze stirs not a leaf,
Yet whispers secrets in my ear of grief;
The moon, a ghostly galleon, glides
Through clouds that drizzle tears and sighs.

And I, a wanderer, forsaken lie,
Beneath the cypress trees' perpetual sigh;
Their branches seem to grasp and cling,
As if they would conspire with my despair's sting.
The wind it howls, like some lost soul's cry,
Echoing through my heart, as mine own spirit doth fly;
