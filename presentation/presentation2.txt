O, Woody's realm, where plastic hearts do beat,
And wooden limbs with joyous laughter meet,
In Andy's room, where sunbeams dance and play,
A world of toys, in endless revelry sway.

'Tis a kingdom of wonder, born of dreams,
Where Jessie's spunk and Buzz's valor beam,
Rex's roar and Slinky's coils do entwine the fun,
And Mr. Potato Head's waxy grin is won. 

The Sheriff, wise and just, doth keep the peace,
As Bullseye prances forth, with steady release, 
The toys, in perfect harmony, do sing,
Their joyous anthem, echoing, 'To infinity and beyond!'

But when the darkness falls, and lights grow low,
The toys must part, their vigil to bestow,
And as they leave, their memories remain,
Of laughter, love, and endless, joyful refrain.

So let this be our creed, dear friends of play,
To cherish every moment, come what may,
For in the world of toys, we find our glee,
And in each other's company, our hearts are free.
