      "Cursed Fate! that erstwhile shone so bright,\nWith promise of fair fortune's guiding light,\nNow wrapt in darkness, and with treach'ry's might,\nDoth seek to crush thy noble spirit's flight.\n\nThy once-untainted heart, where honor's shrine\nDidst glow with fervent zeal, and virtue's mine,\nNow overgrown with weeds of doubt and fear,\nDoth wither, like a rose in winter's bier.\n\nThe whispering winds of whispers sly,\nThat whispered secrets, as the moon didst lie,\nIn silence, to thy willing ear, now sigh\nA mournful dirge, that doth thy soul deny.\n\nYet still, within thy breast, a spark remains,\nOf courage, like a dying flame's faint gleams;\nAnd though the tempest rages wild and vain,\nIt shall not quench the fire that in thy heart sustains."
