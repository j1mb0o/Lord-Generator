["As twilight falls on life's decaying shore,\nAnd midnight's darkness starts to pour,\nThe winds of memory begin their flight,\nAnd whispers of what's past take up the fight.\nOh! then I'll hold thee close, my heart's last light,\nAnd in thy eyes, a dying spark take flight;\nFor though thou art gone, and I remain behind,\nMy love for thee will be, like summer's wind.", "Oh fairest one, whose eyes like morning shine,\nWith beauty's radiance, thy path divine;\nThou walkest forth, as if thy feet were bound\nTo steps where glory waits, and honor's found.\n\nThe winds that whispers secrets in my ear,\nOf conquests won, and triumphs yet to hear;\nThey tell me of a love, whose passion's fire\nBurns bright as stars, and with a single ire;\n\nOh fairest one, thy beauty's cruel might,\nTakes hold of me, and holds it by the light;\nIt chains my heart, and binds my will in thrall,\nAs if thy charms had conquered all.\n\nYet dare I hope, that thou may'st yet be mine,\nAnd in thy love, my every care entwine;\nFor though the world, with all its power and might,\nMay try to tear me from thy radiant light;\n\nMy heart, like yours, is made of passions' fire,\nThat in thy love, our souls may conspire;\nAnd though the Fates, that cruelly decree\nOur fate, yet I shall struggle, wild and free."]
